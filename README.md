# universal-dynamics-with-globally-controlled-analog-system
This repository hosts the public code accompanying our preprint “Universal Dynamics with Globally Controlled Analog Quantum Simulators” (arXiv:2508.19075).  The code provides implementations of the theoretical framework and numerical simulations presented in the paper, enabling reproducibility and further exploration. 
Code will be uploaded.

# GRAPE (jax backend code)
The GRAPE code can be found in the ./GRAPE_code folder

# Direct Optimization
The direct method is partially open sourced in [https://github.com/harmoniqs/ZXZ-atoms/blob/main/ZXZ.ipynb]
